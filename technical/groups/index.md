## The difference between Interest Groups and Task Groups

The [TDWG by-laws](https://www.tdwg.org/about/process/) describes two kinds of working groups: Interest Groups and Task Groups. The fundamental difference between these two kinds of groups is that an Interest Group is ongoing and continues to exist until there is no longer sufficient interest in the group's topic of interest, while a Task Group only continues to exist until its designated task is completed.

[Vocabulary Maintenance Groups](http://rs.tdwg.org/vms/doc/specification/#21-vocabulary-maintenance-interest-groups) are a special type of Interest Group described by the [TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](http://rs.tdwg.org/vms/doc/specification/). They have only one purpose: to maintain one or more vocabulary standards. Unlike a regular interest group, they cannot cease to exist as long as the vocabularies they maintain remain in use. If the convener of a Vocabulary Maintenance Group does not keep the group going, the Executive Committee must replace them.

## Who can start an Interest Group?

Anyone can start an Interest Group by organizing a group of interested people and writing a charter.
